### Performance Optimization
- Implement memory management best practices
- Use lazy loading for image galleries
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Optimize network requests and data persistence

## Testing

### Unit Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
fastlane test_unit

# Run specific test suite
fastlane test_unit suite:"AuthenticationTests"
```

### UI Testing
```bash
# Run UI tests
fastlane test_ui

# Run platform-specific tests
fastlane test_ui platform:"ios"
fastlane test_ui platform:"tvos"
```

### Continuous Integration
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance regression testing
- Screenshot testing for UI verification

## Deployment

### Manual Deployment

|  ├── Network    |
|  ├── Storage    |
|  └── Cache      |
+------------------+
```

### Data Flow
1. User interaction triggers view events
2. ViewModels process business logic
3. Services handle data operations
4. Models maintain application state
5. Views update based on state changes

## Contributing

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Implement changes following style guide
3. Submit pull request with tests
4. Address review feedback
5. Merge after approval

### Code Review Guidelines
- Verify platform compatibility
- Check memory management
- Validate UI/UX consistency
- Ensure test coverage
- Review documentation updates

## Security

### Data Protection
- Implement App Transport Security
- Use Keychain for sensitive data
- Implement certificate pinning
- Enable data encryption at rest

### Authentication
- Biometric authentication support
- Secure token management
- Session timeout handling
- OAuth 2.0 implementation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean build folder
xcodebuild clean

# Reset CocoaPods
pod deintegrate
pod install
```

#### Code Signing
1. Verify certificate validity
2. Update provisioning profiles
3. Reset keychain if necessary
4. Check entitlements configuration

#### Performance Issues
1. Profile with Instruments
2. Check memory leaks
3. Analyze network calls
4. Review crash reports
