Comprehensive documentation for MemoryReel's Android mobile and Android TV applications, implementing a Netflix-style interface for seamless family memory management.

## Overview

MemoryReel Android platform provides a unified development approach for both mobile and TV applications, optimized for their respective form factors and interaction models.

### Project Architecture
- React Native (v0.72.4) core with native Android modules
- Platform-specific UI components and navigation patterns
- Shared business logic between mobile and TV variants
- Performance-optimized media handling and streaming

### Platform-Specific Features
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized interface, camera integration, offline support
- **TV**: Netflix-style navigation, D-pad optimization, 10-foot UI design
- **Cross-Platform**: Shared authentication, content sync, AI features

### TV Interface Design
- Horizontal content carousels with focus management
- Remote-friendly navigation patterns
- Large-format media optimization
- Voice search integration
- Custom animations and transitions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading and virtualization
- Efficient memory management
- Optimized image caching
- Smart prefetching strategies

## Prerequisites

### Development Environment
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- JDK 11+
- Node.js 16+
- React Native CLI
- Android SDK (Target: 33, Min: 23)

### TV Development Requirements
